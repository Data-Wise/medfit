# Hex Logo Prompt for medfit Package

## For AI Image Generators (DALL-E, Midjourney, Gemini, etc.)

Create a professional hexagonal sticker logo for an R package called "medfit" with the following specifications:

### Shape & Format
- Hexagonal shape (like a standard R package hex sticker)
- Border: thick border in academic blue (#0054AD)
- Background: clean white or very light gray (#F8F9FA)
- Dimensions: 181px × 209px (standard R hex sticker ratio)

### Typography
- Package name "medfit" at the bottom
- Font: Modern, clean sans-serif (similar to Montserrat or Inter)
- Color: Academic blue (#0054AD)
- Size: Bold and readable

### Visual Design Concept (Choose ONE)

**Option 1: Path Diagram**
- Central icon showing a simple mediation path diagram
- Three connected nodes: X → M → Y
- Arrows connecting them in a triangular/path arrangement
- Minimalist, geometric style
- Colors: Blue (#0054AD) for paths, light gray for nodes
- Modern, clean lines

**Option 2: Infrastructure Blueprint**
- Abstract geometric representation of "infrastructure"
- Overlapping shapes suggesting building blocks/foundation
- Grid or blueprint aesthetic
- Colors: Shades of blue (#0054AD, lighter tints)
- Technical, architectural feel

**Option 3: Data Flow**
- Abstract flowing lines representing data transformation
- Three distinct flow paths merging and connecting
- Gradient effect with blues
- Modern, tech-forward aesthetic
- Suggests "fitting" data through models

### Style Guidelines
- **Aesthetic**: Academic, professional, modern, clean
- **Avoid**: Overly complex designs, too many colors, clipart style
- **Mood**: Trustworthy, scientific, precise, foundational
- **Reference packages**: Look at tidyverse, ggplot2 hex stickers for style inspiration

### Color Palette
- Primary: #0054AD (academic blue)
- Secondary: #F8F9FA (light background)
- Accent: #FFFFFF (white)
- Optional: Lighter blue tints (#4A90E2, #7FB3E8) for gradients

### Technical Requirements
- High resolution (at least 600 DPI for print)
- Clean vector-style appearance
- Transparent background outside hexagon
- Professional quality suitable for package website and stickers

### Context
medfit is the foundation package for a mediation analysis ecosystem in R. It provides:
- Infrastructure for fitting mediation models
- Path coefficient extraction
- Bootstrap inference
- S7-based modern architecture

The logo should convey: **reliability, precision, scientific rigor, and foundational infrastructure**.

## Recommended Prompt for DALL-E/Midjourney/Gemini:

"Create a professional hexagonal logo sticker for an R statistics package called 'medfit'. The hex sticker should have a thick border in academic blue (#0054AD). Inside, show a minimalist geometric mediation path diagram with three connected nodes (X → M → Y) representing a statistical path model. Use clean, modern lines in blue (#0054AD) on a white background. The package name 'medfit' should appear at the bottom in bold, modern sans-serif font. Style: clean, academic, professional, inspired by tidyverse R package hex stickers. High quality, vector-style appearance."
