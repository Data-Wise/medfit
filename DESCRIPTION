Description: Provides S7-based infrastructure for fitting mediation models,
    extracting path coefficients, and performing bootstrap inference. Designed
    as a foundation package for the mediation analysis ecosystem, supporting
    probmed, RMediation, and medrobust packages. Implements unified interfaces
    for model fitting across different engines (GLM, with future support for
    mixed models and Bayesian methods), standardized extraction of mediation
    paths from various model types, and robust bootstrap inference methods.
